# Python_project1
This project aims to provide actionable insights that can drive strategic business decisions and enchance the store's overall performance in the competitive online market.
# Project Objectives
Describe data to uncover insights by removing duplicate , null values and provide a clean data for visualization
Gain valuable insights that will help improve online retail performance
Provide analytic insights and data-driven recommendations

EDA was conducted to gain insights into top 10 selling products and countries . This allowed us to tailor marketing strategies and promotions to specific products and countries that has less sales. By analyzing most valuable customer id and busiest month, we addressed pain points and enhanced the online shopping experience. 

# Steps to complete the project
First step was to ensure that the data is comprehensive, relevant, and aligned with the project goals.  
      -Cleaning the data by handling missing values and duplicates
      -Creating a tidy dataset that is suitable for analysis.
      -Visualizing the data using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to gain insight
      -Analyzing and summarizing data distributions, correlations, and relationships between variables.

 In conclusion, the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of our dataset revealed several key insights:
- The dataset consists of 401604 records with no missing values, making it a clean and complete dataset for analysis.
- Total Sales of all the products is $8278519.42.
- November is the busiset month for the store.
- The most valuable customer is Customeid 14646.00 and total sales of 279489
- We observed that Regency Cakestand 3 tier is the top selling product of online Retail store followed by White Hanging Heart T-Light Holder.
- United Kingdom is the top selling country for the store
While this EDA provided valuable insights, it is important to note that further analysis, including predictive modeling and hypothesis testing, is needed to make data-driven decisions and validate our findings
